				<p>When ordering food at a restaurant, do you ever feel pressure to get a different dish than what you wanted because someone else is getting it?  I donâ€™t know why I feel like we all need to be eating something different at a restaurant when we eat the same thing every night at home.</p>

				<p>Since I cook (and we are poor students), sometimes it is hard for me to spend a lot of money on food when going out because I can often replicate the same dish for a fraction of what it costs at the restaurant.  At the Cheesecake Factory, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta costs about $16 which I think is a lot for a pasta dish so I decided that I would try to replicate this yummy dish.  </p>

				<p>I saw my mom do this kind of thing pretty often when I was growing up.  She would memorize what exactly was in a food she ate or grab a take-out menu with the menu item descriptions and voila!  A restaurant meal made at home!  So here it is: Louisiana Chicken Pasta served right in your home for about only $7 for the whole meal! (Note: You will spend more buying the ingredients, but for the amounts of each ingredient you use the meal comes to $7.)</p>
